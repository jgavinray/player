# Player

A simple player that I use to play mp3s on my system. 
I have begun to loathe the heavyweight marketing driven applications that play music in 2024, so I now have this. 
Future features maybe add things like random play lists, remote play from a filesystem or server in my network. 
Who knows?  Just fun and I get to play around with Rust.

## Development Toolchain
* [rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) version 1.76.0 

### Sample Usage

```bash
./player ./WILD\ Workout\ at\ Noon\ 107.7\ FM\,\ 4_13_97\,\ Pt.\ 1\ \(320\ kbps\).mp3 
```

#### Fair Use
I have included a copy of an mp3 file that is an performance I heard live on Wild 107.7 in the San Francisco Bay Area, USA. 
Any copyrights and ownership of the performance are attributed to [Wild 94.9](https://wild949.iheart.com/), this file is only being used to research the use of .mp3 files in applcations.
